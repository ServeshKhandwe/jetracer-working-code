[INFO] [1755805247.687583]: Reasoning: The robot is relatively close to the goal with a distance of 0.44 meters. The angle to the goal is -62.3 degrees relative to the robot's heading, requiring a significant angular adjustment. Given there are no close obstacles, it is safe to increase the angular velocity to -0.62 rad/s to align more quickly with the goal, while maintaining the current linear velocity of 0.2 m/s to continue progressing towards the goal.

The angular velocity of -0.62 rad/s is being maintained to correct the heading towards the goal, as the robot needs to adjust its heading by -62.3 degrees to face the goal directly.

[INFO] [1755805253.732131]: Reasoning: The robot needs to adjust its heading towards the goal. The angle to the goal is -160.3 degrees relative to its current heading, indicating a need for a significant clockwise rotation. The maximum angular velocity of 0.8 rad/s is used to achieve this rotation quickly. Since there are no close obstacles, a moderate linear velocity of 0.2 m/s is maintained to continue progressing towards the goal while rotating.

[INFO] [1755805256.067393]: Reasoning: The robot is relatively close to the goal with a small angle difference to the goal direction. Given no close obstacles, a moderate linear velocity is set to close the distance, with a slight angular adjustment to align more precisely with the goal.

[INFO] [1755805260.570713]: Reasoning: The robot needs to adjust its heading towards the goal. The angle to the goal relative to the robot's heading is -175.1 degrees, indicating a need to turn left. Given no close obstacles, a higher angular velocity of 0.7 rad/s is chosen to quickly align with the goal, while maintaining the current linear velocity of 0.25 m/s to continue progressing towards the goal.
